### Notes

* No `startingAt`/`priceTeaser`/`packagePrice` anywhere ‚Äî **only** `price`.
* Card features are derived from the first two include groups to match your ‚Äútop 5‚Äù list.
* Detail page uses `sectionCtas()` (Request proposal / Book a call); the pinned card uses the same card data with `variant: "rail"`.

Want me to add this to a `registry/index.ts` with lookups (`PACKAGE_CARDS`, `PACKAGE_DETAILS`) so your page can import from one place?
