### How `details.ts` maps from this README

* `title` ‚Üí **Title**  
* `valueProp` ‚Üí **Value Prop**  
* `icp` ‚Üí **ICP**  
* `service` / `tags` ‚Üí **Service/Tags**  
* `price` ‚Üí **Price (Money)**  
* `outcomes` ‚Üí **Outcomes** bullets  
* `includesTable.sections` ‚Üí **What‚Äôs Included** groups (A/B/C)  
* `notes` ‚Üí **Notes / Guardrails** + **Timeline** (two paragraphs)

Everything needed by `PackageDetailOverview` is now present in one place; `card.ts` simply reuses the top-5 **Pinned Card highlights** (and the same `price`).

---

### Notes

* No `startingAt`/`priceTeaser`/`packagePrice` anywhere ‚Äî **only** `price`.
* Card features are derived from the first two include groups to match your ‚Äútop 5‚Äù list.
* Detail page uses `sectionCtas()` (Request proposal / Book a call); the pinned card uses the same card data with `variant: "rail"`.

Want me to add this to a `registry/index.ts` with lookups (`PACKAGE_CARDS`, `PACKAGE_DETAILS`) so your page can import from one place?
