### Package Tiers (3 Per Service)
- **Essential** - Entry-level packages for small businesses
- **Professional** - Comprehensive solutions for growing businesses  
- **Enterprise** - Premium packages for large organizations

### Package Types
- **Packages** - Core tiered service offerings (3 per service)
- **Add-Ons** - A la carte enhancements (3-6 per service)
- **Featured** - Top 3 packages highlighted on service pages
- **Bundles** - Cross-service integrated solutions (5 total)

### Cross-Service Bundles (5 Total)
- **Local Business Growth** - $12,500 setup + $2,500/month
- **Digital Transformation Starter** - $30,000 setup + $7,500/month

- **Thought Leadership & Brand Authority** - $15,000 setup + $5,000/month
- **Event & Launch Domination** - $25,000 setup + $6,000/month

## 📊 Data Conventions

### Pricing Format
- **Always numeric** in data files (no currency symbols)
- Use dollars as the base unit (not cents)
- Format currency only in UI components using `toMoney()` helper

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
price: { setup: 2500, monthly: 1200 }

// ❌ Wrong  
price: { setup: "$2,500", monthly: "$1,200" }
```

### ID Conventions
- **Format**: `service-descriptor` (kebab-case)
- **Examples**: `seo-essential`, `content-professional`, `video-ugc-kit`
- Use helper functions: `makePackageId()`, `makeAddOnId()`, `makeFeaturedId()`

### Service Slugs (Fixed)
```typescript
"content" | "leadgen" | "marketing" | "seo" | "webdev" | "video"
```

## 🏗 File Structure Per Service

Each service folder contains exactly 6 files:

```
service-name/
├── service-name-packages.ts    # 3 tier packages (Essential/Pro/Enterprise)
├── service-name-packages.md    # Marketing copy for packages
├── service-name-addons.ts      # 3-6 add-on enhancements  
├── service-name-addons.md      # Marketing copy for add-ons
├── service-name-featured.ts    # Exactly 3 featured cards
└── service-name-featured.md    # Marketing copy for featured
```

### Core Directory Functions

#### `_types/`
- **`packages.types.ts`** - Single source of truth for all TypeScript interfaces
- **`currency.ts`** - UI formatting helpers (toMoney, toStartingPrice, etc.)

#### `_utils/`
- **`slugs.ts`** - Canonical service slugs and type guards
- **`ids.ts`** - Safe ID generation with kebab-case sanitation
- **`index.ts`** - Re-export barrel for clean imports

#### `_validators/`
- **`packages.validate.ts`** - Runtime checks for data integrity
- **`schema.ts`** - Optional Zod/Yup schemas for extra validation

#### `bundles/`
- **Individual bundle files** - Cross-service integrated solutions
- **Each bundle** - Combines 4-6 services into complete business solutions

## ✅ Quality Standards

### Package Requirements
- [ ] Each service has exactly 3 packages (Essential, Professional, Enterprise)
- [ ] Each service has exactly 3 featured cards
- [ ] Each service has 3-6 add-ons
- [ ] All prices are numeric (no currency symbols)
- [ ] All featured cards reference valid package IDs
- [ ] All IDs follow kebab-case convention

### Content Requirements  
- [ ] Each package has clear outcomes and features
- [ ] Each add-on specifies billing model and deliverables
- [ ] Each featured card has compelling headlines and highlights
- [ ] Marketing copy (`.md` files) is benefit-focused

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Validation functions pass (run validation script)
- [ ] No duplicate IDs across all packages and add-ons
- [ ] Proper import/export structure maintained

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding a New Package
1. Edit the appropriate `*-packages.ts` file
2. Add marketing copy to `*-packages.md`
3. Update featured cards if this becomes a top package
4. Run validation to check data integrity
5. Test UI integration in relevant components

### Adding a New Add-On
1. Edit the appropriate `*-addons.ts` file  
2. Add marketing copy to `*-addons.md`
3. Specify `pairsBestWith` tiers for upsell logic
4. Run validation and test integration

### Creating Cross-Service Bundles
1. Create new file in `/bundles/` folder
2. Define integrated modules from multiple services
3. Add to `integrated-growth-packages.ts` export
4. Create corresponding `.md` file for marketing copy

### Validation Process
Run the validation functions to ensure:
- Unique IDs across all packages/add-ons
- Numeric pricing format
- Featured card references exist
- Exactly 3 featured per service
- Proper ID format (kebab-case)

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Import Packages in Components
```typescript
import { 
  SEOFeatured, 
  ContentProductionPackages, 
  toMoney 
} from "@/data/packages";

// Get all content production packages
const packages = ContentProductionPackages;

// Get featured SEO cards  
const featuredCards = SEOFeatured;

// Format pricing
const price = toMoney(2500); // "$2,500"
```

### Get Recommendations
```typescript
import { getRecommendedPackages } from "@/data/packages";

// Get top 3 recommendations for SEO service
const recommendations = getRecommendedPackages("seo");
```

### Access Bundles
```typescript
import { 
  INTEGRATED_GROWTH_BUNDLES,
  getBundleBySlug,
  getBundlesByCategory 
} from "@/data/packages";

// Get all bundles
const allBundles = INTEGRATED_GROWTH_BUNDLES;

// Get specific bundle
const localBundle = getBundleBySlug("local-business-growth");

// Get bundles by category
const ecommerceBundles = getBundlesByCategory("ecommerce");
```

### Search Packages
```typescript
import { searchPackages } from "@/data/packages";

// Search across all packages
const results = searchPackages("content marketing");
```

## 🎨 Marketing Copy Guidelines

### Package Descriptions
- Lead with business outcomes, not features
- Use specific metrics when possible ("40% increase in...")
- Address the target customer's pain points
- Keep technical jargon minimal

### Featured Card Headlines
- Benefit-driven (not feature-driven)
- 6-8 words maximum for scannability
- Action-oriented language
- Avoid generic terms like "solution" or "package"

### Add-On Descriptions  
- Clearly explain when/why to use
- Specify prerequisites or dependencies
- Include timeline expectations
- Highlight ROI or efficiency gains

### Bundle Positioning
- Focus on complete business problems solved
- Emphasize cross-service integration benefits
- Highlight cost savings vs individual services
- Include clear implementation timelines

## 🚀 Production Standards

### Before Deploying Package Changes
- [ ] All TypeScript files compile successfully
- [ ] Package validation passes without errors
- [ ] Marketing copy reviewed and approved
- [ ] UI components updated to reflect changes
- [ ] Pricing aligned with current business strategy
- [ ] Cross-references between packages verified
- [ ] Bundle integration tested end-to-end

### Code Quality
- [ ] Follow established naming conventions
- [ ] Use type-safe imports and exports
- [ ] Maintain consistent data structure
- [ ] Include proper error handling
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Common Validation Errors
- **Duplicate IDs** - Each package/add-on needs unique identifier
- **Invalid price format** - Must be numbers, not strings
- **Missing package reference** - Featured card refers to non-existent package
- **Wrong featured count** - Must be exactly 3 per service
- **Broken bundle references** - Bundle modules reference invalid services

### Data Integrity Checks
```typescript
// Example validation usage
import { validateAll } from "@/data/packages";

const errors = validateAll(packages, addOns, featured, bundles);
if (errors.length > 0) {
  console.error("Validation errors:", errors);
}
```
