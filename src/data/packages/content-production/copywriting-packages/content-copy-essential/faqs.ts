    q: "What counts as a “piece” of content?",
    a: "Typical pieces: a blog post, one email campaign, a single web page, or a set of ~4–6 social captions counted as one piece. Larger/complex items may count as multiple pieces; we confirm during intake.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many revision rounds are included?",
    a: "Two rounds per piece focused on clarity, tone, and accuracy. Structural changes that substantially alter the brief may count as new scope.",
  },
  {
    q: "What SEO work is included?",
    a: "On-page basics: keyword targeting, titles/meta, internal links, and readability. Technical SEO and link-building are out of scope.",

    q: "Do unused pieces roll over?",
    a: "No—this plan is optimized for a steady monthly cadence. If you anticipate a surge, we can temporarily flex capacity.",

    q: "Will you publish the content in our CMS or ESP?",
    a: "Publishing is not included in Essential. We can hand off formatted copy or coordinate with a content management package.",
