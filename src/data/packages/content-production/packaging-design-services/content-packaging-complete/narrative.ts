  <h2>Why a Complete Packaging System?</h2>
  <p>Families of products need consistency and scale. We design a modular system that unifies look and feel, reduces print risk, and streamlines vendor handoff.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shared rules for typography, color, and claims across variants.</li>
    <li>Prepress rigor avoids costly reprints.</li>
    <li>Unboxing and sustainability baked into the system.</li>
  </ul>
