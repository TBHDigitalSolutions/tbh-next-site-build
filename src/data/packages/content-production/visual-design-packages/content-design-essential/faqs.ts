    q: "What counts as a “graphic design piece”?",
    a: "Typical items include social tiles, simple web banners, one-pagers, flyers, or ads. Multi-page or complex pieces may count as multiple items depending on scope.",

    q: "How fast are turnarounds?",
    a: "Most Essential requests complete in 3–5 business days. Larger or multi-variant items may be milestone-scoped.",

  {
    q: "Do unused pieces roll over to the next month?",
    a: "No. The package is designed for a steady monthly cadence. If you expect a surge, we can temporarily increase capacity or add an accelerator add-on.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we request brand updates later?",
    a: "Yes—minor brand sheet updates are included. Major identity work (e.g., full rebrand) is out of scope for Essential and can be quoted separately.",
