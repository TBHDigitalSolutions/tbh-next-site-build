    q: "What does “unlimited requests (fair use)” mean?",
    a: "Submit as many tickets as you like; we work the prioritized queue. Most items ship in 1–3 business days. Larger initiatives are milestone-scoped.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you support rush or same-day requests?",
    a: "Yes. Same/next-day is typical for small assets; complex items are phased so critical pieces land first.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will you maintain our brand system and component library?",
    a: "Yes—versioned Figma components, templates, and guardrails are maintained and expanded as channels evolve.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you hand off to engineering or partners?",
    a: "Organized source files, dev-ready specs (Zeplin/Figma), export presets, and annotated redlines.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you check for accessibility?",
    a: "Yes. Contrast, reflow, typography scales, and alt-text patterns are part of our QA checklist targeting WCAG AA.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we pause or cancel?",
    a: "Cancel anytime with 30-day notice. Pauses are fine for seasonal programs; libraries are preserved.",
