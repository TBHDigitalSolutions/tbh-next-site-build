    <h2>Why Enterprise Visual Design</h2>
    <p>When multiple teams ship creative every week, governance matters as much as velocity. This package pairs senior art direction with a scalable production lane, ensuring every asset is <em>on-brand, accessible, and implementation-ready</em>.</p>
    <h3>How we work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plan weekly</strong> — shared roadmap, capacity, and acceptance criteria.</li>
      <li><strong>Design in systems</strong> — componentized patterns and channel templates.</li>
      <li><strong>QA before handoff</strong> — brand, specs, and accessibility checks baked in.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure & improve</strong> — quarterly reviews of throughput and outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
