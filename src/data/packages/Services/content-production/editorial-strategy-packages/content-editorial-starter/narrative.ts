    <h2>Why a Strategy Starter?</h2>
    <p>A clear strategy turns ad-hoc publishing into a predictable program. Starter gives you the plan, voice, and measurement you need for the next six months.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Audit and competitive analysis surface quick wins and gaps.</li>
      <li>Roadmap and calendar align teams on priorities and cadence.</li>
      <li>Voice/style and KPI setup keep every asset consistent and measurable.</li>
    </ul>
