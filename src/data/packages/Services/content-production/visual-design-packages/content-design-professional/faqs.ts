    q: "What qualifies as one “design piece” in Professional?",
    a: "A single deliverable sized for one context (e.g., a social post or a print flyer). Multi-size ad sets or multi-page documents may count as multiple pieces depending on scope; we’ll confirm during intake.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast are turnarounds?",
    a: "Typical requests complete in 2–4 business days. Larger or multi-variant projects are milestone-scoped so priority items land first.",
  },
  {
    q: "What’s included in the complete brand identity system?",
    a: "A logo suite, color and typography systems, usage/clear-space rules, and a compact brand guide. Complex rebrands or naming work can be quoted separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do unused pieces roll over?",
    a: "No—Professional is designed for a steady monthly cadence. If you anticipate a spike, we can flex capacity or add a Rapid accelerator.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you coordinate with printers and event vendors?",
    a: "Yes. We prepare print-ready files and provide vendor specs when available; final vendor fees are billed directly to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide source files?",
    a: "Yes—source files for identity and templates are provided, along with production-ready exports (PNG/SVG/PDF as applicable).",
