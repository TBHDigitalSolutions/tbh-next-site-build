- Cancellations made **within 24 hours** of the scheduled time may be subject to a cancellation fee (up to the full session value).
- **No-shows** will be charged in full.
- If we must cancel or reschedule, you will be offered the earliest available alternative at no additional cost.
- All cancellations must be confirmed through the booking system (email or dashboard confirmation).
