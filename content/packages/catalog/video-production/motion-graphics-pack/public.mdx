summary: "Reusable motion system (logo sting, lower thirds, transitions, end cards) that makes every video feel on-brand and professionally finished."
description: >
  A compact, reusable motion system you can drop into any video: a bespoke logo
  sting, animated lower thirds, chapter/segment bumpers, transitions and end cards—
  packaged as easy-to-use templates for your editor of choice. Consistent motion
  = higher polish, better recall, and faster production.

# ICP & PURPOSE (Phase 2)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
icp: "Content and marketing teams shipping video regularly who want consistent, on-brand motion without reinventing the wheel each time."

painPoints:
  - "Inconsistent motion makes the brand feel disjointed across channels"
  - "Editors rebuild the same elements for every project"
  - "Lower thirds and bumpers aren’t accessible or caption-safe"
  - "No shared source files; updates are slow and error-prone"
  - "Social variants (1:1, 9:16) are missing or last-minute"

outcomes:
  - "Faster post-production with drop-in motion templates"
  - "Consistent brand presence across all videos"
  - "Higher viewer retention around section changes"
  - "Professional polish that lifts perceived quality"
  - "Team-wide reuse with documented, editable source files"

## Overview

The **Motion Graphics Pack** standardizes your motion language so every video feels cohesive and professional. Editors drop pre-rendered elements or open project files to customize, while documented safe-areas and presets keep output consistent across channels.

### What you’ll get

- A branded **logo sting**, **lower thirds**, **bumpers**, **transitions**, and **end cards**  
- Templates for **Premiere/After Effects** (Resolve optional) and **pre-renders** for speed  
- **Multi-format masters** (16:9, 1:1, 9:16) for web and social  
- A **usage guide** so anyone on the team can apply the system correctly

## Purpose

Establish a **reusable motion system** that speeds production and tightens brand consistency. Instead of rebuilding assets per project, your team works from a shared, documented library—reducing edits, improving accessibility (caption-safe, contrast-checked), and raising perceived production value across every channel.

## FAQ

**Which apps are supported?**  
Premiere Pro and After Effects by default, Resolve on request. You’ll receive both editable projects and pre-renders.

**Can we change colors or CTA text later?**  
Yes. Templates expose color tokens and text layers; our guide shows safe edits.

**Do you include music?**  
We include simple SFX and a sting hit. Music licensing isn’t included but we can recommend libraries or add it as an optional service.

**Is this usable for live streams or webinars?**  
Yes—the lower thirds, bumpers, and transitions work well in event contexts. We can add stream-specific layouts as an add-on.

## Notes

- One brand system & language included; additional brands/languages available as add-ons  
- Character animation/3D/live-action are out of scope for this pack (available separately)  
- Typical turnaround is **2–3 weeks** from kickoff with timely feedback
