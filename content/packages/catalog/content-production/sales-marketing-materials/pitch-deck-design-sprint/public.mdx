# HERO SECTION (Phase 1)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
summary: "A fast, high-touch sprint to craft (or overhaul) an investor-ready or sales-ready pitch deck — story first, then crisp, consistent design."
description: >
  We structure your story, build a strong visual system, and produce a focused, persuasive deck.
  You get a narrative arc investors and buyers actually follow, slides that scale, and exports that
  look great on every screen.

# ICP & PURPOSE (Phase 2)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
icp: "Founders and revenue leaders preparing for investor meetings, board reviews, or high-stakes sales pitches."

painPoints:
  - "Story is scattered; slides read like a doc not a pitch"
  - "Visual inconsistency undermines credibility and flow"
  - "Charts are hard to parse; proof points don’t land"
  - "No reusable master — every revision starts from scratch"
  - "Exports break in screen share or email-forward contexts"

outcomes:
  - "↑ Clear investor/buyer narrative with a beginning–middle–end"
  - "↑ Consistent, on-brand visual system & slide master"
  - "↑ Polished data visuals and proof points that land quickly"
  - "↓ Prep time with reusable layouts and speaker notes"
  - "↑ Export-perfect files for screen share and PDF send"

purpose: >
  Build a persuasive, easy-to-follow narrative and a clean, reusable slide system so you can run
  confident meetings, handle Q&A without losing the room, and send a deck that still works when forwarded.

## Overview

A great pitch isn’t a data dump — it’s a **guided story** that reduces cognitive load, makes your *ask* obvious, and earns second meetings. **Pitch Deck Design Sprint** moves quickly from narrative framing to a clean, reusable slide system, then ships a focused deck that looks great on every screen and holds up when forwarded.

---

## Purpose

Create a persuasive, easy-to-follow narrative **and** a reusable design system so you can:
- Run confident meetings without losing the room
- Tell the same crisp story across founders, sales, and ops
- Update slides safely without breaking brand or layout
- Send a forwardable PDF that still lands the message

---

## What you get (at a glance)

- **Story map** that orders your argument (problem → solution → traction → ask)  
- **Slide master** with reusable layouts, type, color tokens, and spacing rules  
- **Up to 20 production slides** with clean diagrams & data visuals  
- **Speaker-notes scaffolding** and objection-handling hooks (optional)  
- **Export-perfect files** (screen deck + web PDF ≤ 8MB target)  
- **Editable sources** (Figma or PowerPoint/Keynote)

---

## Process

1. **Kickoff & intake** — goals, audience, constraints, assets  
2. **Story map** — section flow, headline hierarchy, proof mapping  
3. **First design pass** — master, key slides, diagram/data patterns  
4. **Reviews ×2** — structured rounds with consolidated feedback  
5. **Polish & QA** — accessibility checks, exports, and handoff notes

---

## Good fit

- Pre-raise founders (Seed/Series A) or revenue leaders tightening a high-stakes pitch  
- Teams with content in hand that needs *narrative clarity* and *design consistency*  
- Orgs that want a **reusable** slide system, not a one-off artifact

## Not a fit (add-ons recommended)

- Net-new **messaging platform** from scratch (see *Messaging Playbook*)  
- **Complex financial models**/custom 3D or motion sequences (see add-ons)  
- **Multi-language**/multi-region variants in the same sprint

Share only approved metrics and redact sensitive details. We’ll keep a private working folder and remove source data from exports on request.

## Notes

Scope covers one language, up to 20 slides, and two review rounds. Stock assets and premium fonts are billed at cost with prior approval. For ongoing enablement (case-study slides, ROI calculators, new sections), we can establish a light **deck maintenance** cadence after the sprint.
