# ICP & PURPOSE (Phase 2)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
icp: "B2B teams (seed → enterprise) who need a high-impact, on-brand deck that supports discovery, demo, ROI, and proof."

painPoints:
  - "Inconsistent stories across reps lead to confused buyers"
  - "Legacy decks are off-brand, bloated, or hard to tailor"
  - "Charts are hard to parse; proof points don’t land quickly"
  - "No reusable master; every edit breaks styles/layouts"
  - "Exports fail in screen share or forwardable PDF contexts"

outcomes:
  - "↑ Clear, consistent sales narrative across the team"
  - "↑ Higher win rates and faster deal velocity"
  - "↓ Ramp time with a ready-to-tailor base and presenter notes"
  - "↑ On-brand visual system with reusable layouts"
  - "↑ Optional engagement analytics via document tracking"

purpose: >
  Deliver a modular, on-brand deck system—story architecture, slide master, and production slides—so reps can run
  confident conversations from discovery to ROI proof, and send forwardable PDFs that still tell the story.

## Overview

**Sales Deck Pro** is a complete, repeatable story system—narrative architecture, a branded presentation master, and production-ready slides—so your reps can run confident conversations from discovery to ROI proof and send a forwardable PDF that still lands the message.

### What this solves

- Inconsistent narratives across reps  
- Off-brand or bloated legacy decks that are hard to tailor  
- Proof that doesn’t land (unclear charts, weak visuals)  
- Decks that break when edited or export poorly for screen share/PDF

---

## Purpose

Equip your team with a **modular, on-brand deck** that’s fast to tailor and impossible to break. We define the story, design a presentation system that locks in type/grid/color, and produce polished slides with notes and export presets—so every conversation feels crisp, credible, and consistent.

---

## What you get (highlights)

- **Story architecture** mapped to ICP, use cases, and proof  
- **Presentation master** with brand-safe typography, grid, and color tokens  
- **Modular sections** for discovery, demo, ROI, proof, and team  
- **Data visuals & diagrams** aligned to brand and comprehension best practices  
- **Presenter notes** scaffolding and objection-handling hooks  
- **Sources & exports** in Figma and/or PowerPoint/Keynote

---

## Implementation details

We start with a short **discovery + story map**, align on message hierarchy and proof, then produce a **first design pass** across representative slides. You’ll review via tracked comments; we iterate through **two structured rounds** and deliver **sources + exports** with usage guidance your team can follow.

> Want a motion bump for key slides? Pair with **Motion Graphics Pack**. Need a short opener clip? Add **Explainer Video Starter**.
