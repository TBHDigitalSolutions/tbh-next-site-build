summary: "A 10-day sprint to align your positioning, nail your value pillars, and ship a practical playbook—headlines, proof points, and voice guardrails your team can actually use."
description: >
  We turn scattered product notes and slide decks into a single source of truth
  for messaging: positioning statements, value pillars with proof points,
  elevator pitches, headline banks, objection handling, and a practical
  voice-and-tone guide. The result is faster content production and more
  consistent conversion across web, sales, and lifecycle.

# ICP & PURPOSE (Phase 2)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
icp: "B2B teams who need crisp, consistent messaging for websites, sales collateral, and campaigns."

painPoints:
  - "Pages and decks say different things about the same product"
  - "Reviews stall because there’s no shared source of truth"
  - "Headlines talk features, not outcomes—conversion suffers"
  - "New hires struggle to write on-brand without examples"

# Optional: synopsis here; we also include a full body `## Purpose` section below.
purpose: >
  Create a single source of truth for what you say (and how you say it): clear
  positioning and elevator pitch, 3–5 value pillars with proof, voice & tone
  guidance, headline/CTA bank by funnel stage, and objection handling—all
  packaged as a practical playbook your whole team can use tomorrow.

  - "↑ Consistency across web, sales, and lifecycle touchpoints"

## Overview

**Messaging Playbook** is a focused, 10-day sprint that distills positioning, value pillars, voice, and proof into a practical guide your team can open and use immediately. We interview stakeholders, review existing materials, and produce a single source of truth—complete with examples, headlines, and objection handling—for websites, sales collateral, and campaigns.

### What you’ll get

- A **positioning statement** and **elevator pitches** (short/long)  
- **3–5 value pillars** with outcomes and proof points  
- A **voice & tone guide** with do/don’t examples  
- A **headline & CTA bank** mapped to funnel stages  
- **Objection handling** snippets for sales and web  
- **Google Doc + branded PDF** and a live handoff

## Purpose

Create a **single source of truth** for what you say *and* how you say it—so teams ship faster with fewer review loops. By aligning on positioning and pillars, codifying voice & tone, and providing ready-to-use headlines and CTAs, you’ll see more consistent conversion across web, lifecycle, and sales assets.
