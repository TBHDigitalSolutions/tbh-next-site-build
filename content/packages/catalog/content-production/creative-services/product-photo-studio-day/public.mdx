faqs:

    answer: >

## Overview

Consistent, color-accurate product photos are the backbone of high-converting PDPs and ads. This studio day creates a repeatable system—shot list, lighting recipe, and export standards—so your team can publish faster and keep your catalog on-brand.

## Purpose

Make product imagery **reliable, repeatable, and brand-sharp**: align on a prioritized shot list, capture with calibrated lighting and **tethered approvals**, and deliver retouched exports (web + print) with clear naming and usage notes. The goal is to speed PDP creation and reduce returns caused by inconsistent visuals.
