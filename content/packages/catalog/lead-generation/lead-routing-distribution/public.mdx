## Overview

**Lead Routing & Distribution** assigns every new lead to the *right* rep in seconds and records *why* they got it.  
We set up territory & round-robin rules, capacity caps, OOO handling, conflict checks, and CRM write-backs so RevOps can  
prove fairness, measure speed-to-lead, and iterate safely.

### At a glance
- **Seconds-fast assignment** with territory + round-robin logic  
- **Fairness by design:** daily caps, catch-up rotation, OOO routing  
- **Auditability:** every decision is logged to the CRM with context  
- **Tunable:** starter dashboards + change-log playbook for RevOps

## Purpose

Manual triage doesn't scale and introduces bias. This package establishes a **transparent, rules-driven system** that  
respects territories and capacity, eliminates duplicates and conflicts, and creates a **CRM-side audit trail** so you can  
coach, improve SLAs, and maintain trust with Sales and leadership.

## What makes this effective

This isn't just automation—it's a **governance layer** that makes lead assignment predictable, auditable, and improvable:

- **Territory intelligence:** Respects ownership, regions, and account relationships
- **Fair distribution:** Round-robin with catch-up logic prevents cherry-picking
- **Conflict prevention:** Checks for duplicates and account-owner collisions before assignment
- **Full transparency:** Every routing decision is logged with reason codes
- **RevOps-friendly:** Dashboards and change logs let you tune rules confidently

## How it works

1. **Discovery & Rules Intake:** We map your territories, capacity rules, and exceptions
2. **Sandbox Pilot:** Dry runs with sample data to validate logic and edge cases
3. **Go-Live:** Enable in production with monitoring and fallback queues
4. **Monthly Review:** Performance reports, balance checks, and iterative improvements

## Notes

- Essential tier covers one CRM and one primary territory dimension
- Advanced experiments, enrichment, multi-CRM, and complex SLA orchestration available as add-ons
- All pricing assumes timely access and a single consolidated approver
- Initial setup includes sandbox testing and admin training
