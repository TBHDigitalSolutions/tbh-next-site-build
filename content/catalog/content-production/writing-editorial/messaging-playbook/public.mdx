# Messaging Playbook

A focused sprint to align your positioning, value pillars, voice, and proof—then package everything into a practical playbook your whole team can use.

---

## Why this matters

- Pages and decks say different things about the same product  
- Reviews stall because there’s no “source of truth” to anchor on  
- Headlines talk features, not outcomes—conversion suffers  
- New hires struggle to write “on brand” without examples

---

## Purpose

Create a **single source of truth** for what you say (and how you say it):
- Clear *positioning* and elevator pitch (short/long)
- 3–5 *value pillars* with outcomes and proof points
- *Voice & tone* with do/don’t examples
- A *headline & CTA bank* mapped to funnel stages
- *Objection handling* snippets for sales and web

The result: faster production, fewer edits, and consistent conversion.
