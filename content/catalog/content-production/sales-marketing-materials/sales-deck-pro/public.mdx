# ICP & PURPOSE (Phase 2)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
icp: "B2B teams (seed → enterprise) who need a high-impact, on-brand deck that supports discovery, demo, ROI, and proof."

painPoints:
  - "Inconsistent stories across reps lead to confused buyers"
  - "Legacy decks are off-brand, bloated, or hard to tailor"
  - "Charts are hard to parse; proof points don’t land quickly"
  - "No reusable master; every edit breaks styles/layouts"
  - "Exports fail in screen share or forwardable PDF contexts"

outcomes:
  - "↑ Clear, consistent sales narrative across the team"
  - "↑ Higher win rates and faster deal velocity"
  - "↓ Ramp time with a ready-to-tailor base and presenter notes"
  - "↑ On-brand visual system with reusable layouts"
  - "↑ Optional engagement analytics via document tracking"

purpose: >
  Deliver a modular, on-brand deck system—story architecture, slide master, and production slides—so reps can run
  confident conversations from discovery to ROI proof, and send forwardable PDFs that still tell the story.

## Why this package

A great sales deck is more than pretty slides—it’s a **repeatable story system** that helps reps move a conversation forward. Sales Deck Pro gives you a narrative that maps to your ICP and buying stages, a flexible design system, and a set of reusable modules (discovery, demo, ROI, proof) that make tailoring fast without sacrificing quality.

## What you get

- A clear narrative architecture that aligns to your customer journey  
- A polished presentation system (master styles, grids, spacing, iconography)  
- A modular slide library with reusable layouts and diagram patterns  
- Thorough polish with presenter notes, links, and export-ready files

## Implementation details

We start with a short **discovery + story map**, align on the message hierarchy, and then move to a **first design pass** across representative slides. You’ll review via annotated PDFs or live sessions; we incorporate feedback through two structured rounds and **hand off sources** in your preferred tool.

> Want to extend the deck with animated moments or a short explainer clip? Pair this with **Motion Graphics Pack** or **Explainer Video Starter**.

## FAQ & next steps

If you have a legacy deck, we’ll audit what’s working and fold it into the new system where sensible. Ready to move? Book a quick call and we’ll confirm scope, assets, and timeline—and get your team a deck they actually want to use.
