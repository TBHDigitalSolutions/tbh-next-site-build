## Overview

Assign every qualified lead to the best available owner in seconds. This package
implements transparent, auditable rules that keep workloads balanced, prevent
duplicates, and improve SLA adherence — all with CRM-level write-backs so RevOps
has full visibility.

## Purpose

Ensure fast, fair, and defensible lead assignment that scales with your team.
We operationalize routing logic, capture every decision as a CRM event, and
equip RevOps with a lightweight dashboard to iterate safely.

## Pain points we address

- Slow speed-to-lead from manual assignment  
- Leads slipping through territory/owner exceptions  
- No audit trail → disputes between reps & ops  
- Uneven workload distribution across the team  
- SLA breaches from missing owners or queues  
- Limited visibility into routing performance  

## Outcomes you can expect

- Faster speed-to-lead and consistent handoffs  
- Fair distribution across territories and teams  
- Lower lead leakage and duplicate assignments  
- Higher SLA adherence and more reliable follow-up  
- Clear routing telemetry and change governance  

## What’s included (high-level)

- **Distribution & Assignment** — territories, round-robin, starter rule library, conflict checks  
- **Reporting & Telemetry** — CRM write-backs for routing events, monthly performance dashboard (starter)  
- **Scope & Connectivity** — initial setup for one CRM; primary territory model included  

## Timeline & Turnaround

1. **Setup** — 3–5 business days
