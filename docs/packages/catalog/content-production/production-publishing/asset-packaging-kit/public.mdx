faqs:
  - question: Can you include Figma/Canva export presets?
    answer: Yes. We set component/page export presets and document the workflow so any editor can reproduce exports consistently.
  - question: What if some files are missing or outdated?
    answer: We’ll provide a gap list with recommended actions and placeholders. Replacement or redesign can be scoped as an add-on.
  - question: Do you support multiple brands?
    answer: This kit covers one brand. Additional brands or sub-brands can be added at a reduced incremental scope.
  - question: Do you rename everything?
    answer: We normalize to the agreed convention. We keep an alias map so old names remain discoverable.
  - question: Can you integrate with our DAM?
    answer: Light organization and upload is included. Full DAM taxonomy, metadata, and workflows can be added as a separate project.

notes: >
  Base scope covers one brand, up to ~100 source files, and 10 export presets. Extended libraries, additional brands, and motion/video pipelines are add-ons.

# Overview

Make handoffs painless. The **Asset Packaging Kit** consolidates your brand files into a single,
well-structured bundle with consistent naming, documented export presets, and ready-to-share delivery.
Your team ships faster and spends less time chasing the “latest” files.

---

## Why this (common pain points)

- “Final_v5_FINAL(2).png” chaos across cloud drives  
- Re-exports for every platform size or background variant  
- No single place that’s safe to hand to partners or creators  
- Inconsistent naming and missing license/usage notes  
- Low confidence in “the latest” logo/lockup

**This kit fixes that** with a canonical structure, normalized naming, preset exports, and a short, human guide.

- Size matrix per platform + batch exports of key variants

We preserve source metadata when present and add a LICENSE & CREDITS section in the README.
