summary: Low-risk migration for small–mid content sites with URL parity, SEO hygiene, and clear rollback.
description: |
  A focused, low-risk approach to move a small–mid content site between CMSs (e.g., WordPress ⇄ Webflow, Contentful ⇄ Sanity, HubSpot CMS → Next.js/Headless). We preserve URLs and metadata, implement redirects, port key templates, and validate analytics so traffic and rankings stay intact. You get a repeatable playbook and a safe rollback point.
icp: Teams with ≤100 live URLs that need a safe, well-governed CMS migration without a full redesign.

# CMS Migration Lite

Move your content to a modern CMS **without losing rankings or breaking links**. We inventory and map your content, build a clean redirect plan, preserve metadata & schema, validate analytics, and ship with a **clear rollback** for peace of mind.

---

## Highlights

- Content inventory and mapping (≤100 URLs)  
- 301 redirect plan (≤150 rules) with test proofs  
- Meta/canonical/OG parity & basic schema  
- XML sitemaps, robots.txt, GA4 + Search Console validation  
- Staging QA, timed launch window, and 14-day warranty  
- Playbook + rollback plan for safe cut-over

---

## What’s included

### Discovery & Planning
- Crawl-based inventory (status, depth, duplicates)  
- Content type & field mapping (old → new)  
- Parity matrix for URLs, metadata, schema, media  
- Risk register, cut-over plan, and rollback checkpoints

### Content & Assets Migration
- Up to **100 URLs** migrated (editorial pages/posts)  
- Media export/import and relinking  
- **Two base templates** configured (e.g., Page + Post)  
- Author/date/tags/categories parity where supported

### Technical & SEO
- **301 redirect map** (≤150 rules) with human-readable proofs  
- Title, meta description, canonical, and OG parity  
- XML sitemap regeneration & robots.txt updates  
- Basic **schema parity** (Article/WebPage) where applicable

### QA & Launch
- Staging QA (links, images, forms, 404s, noindex checks)  
- GA4 and Search Console handoff & validation  
- Timed launch window (1–2 hours on-call)  
- Post-launch crawl & error sweep (24–48h)

---

## Why this works

- **Parity first:** preserve URLs, metadata, and crawlability to protect traffic.  
- **Measured cut-over:** testable plan, controlled window, and a rollback.  
- **Proof-driven redirects:** every rule has a test and expected result.  
- **Post-launch sweep:** catch regressions early and fix fast.

---

## Implementation timeline

1. **Inventory & Plan** (3–5 biz days)  
   Crawl, content map, parity matrix, redirect draft, risk/rollback plan.

2. **Migrate & Configure** (1–1.5 weeks)  
   Content + media, templates, metadata/schema parity, staging QA.

3. **Cut-over** (Launch window)  
   DNS/hosting switch, sitemaps & robots, GA4/SC validation, redirect proofs.

4. **Stabilize** (24–48h + 14-day warranty)  
   Post-launch crawl, fix regressions, final handoff & playbook.

---

## Requirements

- Admin access to **current and target CMS** (incl. staging)  
- Hosting/DNS access for cut-over  
- **GA4 & Search Console** permissions  
- Required **content types/templates** list  
- Source CMS **plugin/app list**  
- One **primary domain** in scope

---

## Limits & Ethics

**Scope caps (Lite):** 100 URLs, 150 redirects, 1 domain, 2 templates.  
No e-commerce/app migrations, no full redesign, no i18n (add-on available).

**Ethics:** No scraping without rights; respect site directives and privacy; do not migrate insecure/infected plugins.

---

## FAQ

**Will rankings drop?**  
Our parity-first approach, redirect proofs, and post-launch sweep minimize risk. Short-term fluctuations can occur; the plan is built to protect and recover.

**Can you migrate custom fields/blocks?**  
Yes, when both CMSs support compatible structures. We map fields and document any unavoidable gaps.

**What about complex redirects or many legacy paths?**  
Add **Redirects Pro** to automate large maps, test at scale, and monitor post-launch.

**Do you support multi-language?**  
Yes—add **i18n Starter** for language strategy, URL patterns, and hreflang.

---

### Add-ons to consider

- **Redirects Pro** — large-scale rules, automation, and monitoring  
- **Schema Upgrade** — enhanced structured data beyond parity  
- **Site Performance Hardening** — Core Web Vitals tuning post-migration  
- **CMS Admin Training** — role-based workflows and governance  
- **i18n Starter** — multi-language URL strategy and hreflang

---

> **Price & Terms:** one-time fixed fee for Lite scope (see caps above). Larger libraries, multi-brand, or e-commerce require a Pro migration plan.
