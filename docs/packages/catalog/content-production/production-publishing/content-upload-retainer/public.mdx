## Why this retainer?

Publishing is where great content often stalls—waiting on formatting, links, images, or approvals. This retainer turns **publishing into a reliable, repeatable operation** with clear standards and a visible board so everyone knows what’s live, what’s next, and what’s blocked.

## What you’ll get each month

- **On-brand formatting and SEO hygiene** for posts and landing pages  
- **Light QA** before and after go-live (links, forms, layout checks)  
- **Status visibility** via a publishing board and calendar alignment  
- **Ops improvements** from monthly reporting and small process tweaks

## How it works

1. **Setup (Week 1):** Access, standards, and workflow alignment.  
2. **Intake:** You drop briefs/assets in the agreed lane; we slot and confirm.  
3. **Publish cycles:** We format, QA, request approvals, and go live.  
4. **Monthly review:** Throughput, defects, time-to-publish, and next improvements.

> Need help writing or planning the content itself? Pair this with our **Editorial Calendar Sprint** or **Website Copy Refresh** to keep the pipeline full.
