## Why this matters

Investors and buyers decide quickly. A tight story and consistent visual system reduce cognitive
load, highlight traction, and make your **ask** obvious. This sprint gives you both — fast.

## Purpose

Craft a persuasive narrative and a polished, reusable slide system so you can run confident
meetings, handle Q&A without losing the room, and send a deck that still works when forwarded.

## What you get (at a glance)

- **Story map** that orders your argument
- **Slide master** with reusable layouts
- **Up to 20 production slides** with clean visuals
- **Data charts and diagrams** that can be updated later
- **Export-perfect PDFs** for screen and send

## Process

1. **Kickoff & intake** — goals, audience, constraints, and assets  
2. **Story map** — section flow and message hierarchy  
3. **First design pass** — master, key slides, and 1–2 patterns  
4. **Review & iterate** — two structured rounds  
5. **Polish & QA** — accessibility, exports, and handoff notes

## Good fit

- Pre-raise founders preparing Seed/Series A  
- Sales leaders aligning a high-stakes pitch  
- Teams with content in hand that needs a strong story and design

## Not a fit (use add-ons)

- Net-new **messaging platform** from scratch  
- **Complex financial modeling** or animated video sequences  
- **Multi-language** or multi-region variants in the same sprint
