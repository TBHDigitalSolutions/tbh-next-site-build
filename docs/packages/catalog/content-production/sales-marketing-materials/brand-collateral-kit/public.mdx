## Why this kit?

Your teams need **consistent, on-brand materials** that are fast to update and easy to ship. This kit gives you the **core collateral set**—as **editable templates**—so Sales, Marketing, and Execs can move quickly without breaking the brand.

## What you get

- A prioritized collateral set aligned to your real use-cases
- Press-ready files for print and optimized assets for web
- Editable sources (Figma/Adobe) and a **brand guide lite** for governance
- A short live handoff so your team knows exactly how to use and update everything

## How it works

1. **Audit & Plans** — We review your current brand files, clarify use-cases, and lock the format matrix.  
2. **Design & Review** — We design the set, gather feedback in two rounds, and finalize master templates.  
3. **Handoff** — We export press/web deliverables, organize files, and run a quick training session.

> Need extra items like **event signage**, **tradeshow assets**, or **advanced print finishes**? We can add them to the matrix or scope a follow-on mini-sprint.
