## Why this matters

Content cadence slips when plans live in slide decks and wishful thinking. This sprint translates goals and ICPs into a 90-day, **actually shippable** plan with ownership and acceptance criteria—so writers can draft, reviewers can approve, and the calendar **keeps moving**.

### Common pain points we solve

- Campaigns start without a clear POV or success criteria  
- Topic ideas aren’t prioritized—everything feels “urgent”  
- Reviews stall because roles/SLAs aren’t defined  
- No single source of truth for schedule, links, or status  
- Distribution is an afterthought, so reach underperforms

## What you get

**Planning & Calendar**

- A 90-day schedule mapped to ICP, funnel stage, and goals

## How the sprint works

**Day 1–2 — Kickoff & Inputs**  
Goals, ICPs, product moments, existing content scan, keyword/theme alignment.

**Day 3–5 — Calendar & Backlog**  
We draft the 90-day calendar and prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria.

**Day 7–8 — Briefs & Governance**  
We write 4 briefs and finalize workflow: RACI, SLAs, checklists, and source-of-truth.

**Day 10 — Handoff**  
Walkthrough, materials delivery, and next-steps options.

> Want us to keep the plan fresh? Add a **Monthly Calendar Refresh** (light research + backlog grooming + reprioritization).

- **Blog Article Pack** for consistent monthly production
