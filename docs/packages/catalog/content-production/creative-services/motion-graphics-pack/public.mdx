## Why this pack

When every video uses different motion, the brand feels inconsistent and post-production slows down. A reusable motion system speeds editing, raises perceived quality, and improves recognition. This pack gives you high-quality animated elements that drop into any edit, with social-ready variants and documentation so anyone on the team can use them.

## What you get

- **Logo sting (3–5s)** — tailored motion that matches your brand’s energy  
- **Lower thirds** — long/short variants, optional handle lockups, caption-safe placement  
- **Chapter/segment bumpers** — openers/closers that improve retention  
- **Transitions (2–3 styles)** — smooth handoffs between scenes  
- **End cards (2–3 CTA variants)** — subscribe/follow/visit prompts with URL/QR options  
- **Templates & pre-renders** — AE projects + MOV/PNG sequences; Premiere/Resolve templates  
- **Multi-format masters** — 16:9, 1:1, 9:16  
- **Usage guide** — naming, folders, and how to safely customize

> **Accessibility-first:** Elements are designed with caption safe-areas and contrast in mind to keep subtitles readable.

## Details & process

**Week 1 – Discovery & Direction**  
We align on goals, gather brand assets, and create **style frames** using your colors, logo, and typographic system. You’ll see motion references and choose a direction.

**Week 2 – Build & QA**  
We build the logo sting, lower thirds, bumpers, transitions, and end cards; then package pre-renders and project files. Internal QA checks caption safe-areas, contrast, and loudness.

**Week 3 – Revisions & Handover**  
One consolidated revision round for refinements. We finalize variants (16:9/1:1/9:16), deliver the **usage guide**, and walk you through templates in a 30-minute session.

### Requirements

- Brand kit (logo vectors, color/typography)
- NLE preference (Premiere/Resolve/FCP) + version
- CTA copy/URLs and social handles
- 2–3 example videos (directional)

### FAQ

**Which apps are supported?**  
Premiere Pro and After Effects by default, Resolve on request. You’ll receive both editable projects and pre-renders.

**Can we change colors or CTA text later?**  
Yes. Templates expose color tokens and text layers; our guide shows safe edits.

**Do you include music?**  
We include simple SFX and a sting hit. Music licensing isn’t included but we can recommend libraries or add it as an optional service.

**Is this usable for live streams or webinars?**  
Yes—the lower thirds, bumpers, and transitions work well in event contexts. We can add stream-specific layouts as an add-on.
