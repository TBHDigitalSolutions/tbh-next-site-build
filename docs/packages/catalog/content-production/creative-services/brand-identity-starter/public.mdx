## Overview

Get a cohesive, professional identity without the overhead of a full rebrand. In two weeks we deliver a versatile logo system, accessible color palette, production-ready typography, and a practical one-pager guide—plus ready-to-use exports and Figma sources—so your team can design and publish consistently across web, decks, and social.

## Purpose

This starter is designed to **unblock shipping**. Instead of a sprawling brand project, you get the core system that covers 80–90% of real-world needs:

- A logo family that scales from favicon to billboard  
- Color choices that pass contrast checks and feel on-brand  
- Type styles that work in product, marketing, and slides  
- Lightweight guidance that sets rules without slowing teams down

## How it works

We start with a short discovery to capture your goals and references. Then we run a focused design sprint, present concepts with clear rationale, and iterate through two structured revision rounds. Final assets and sources are delivered in Figma and exported formats, with a live handoff to set you up for success.

## FAQ

**Do we own the source files?**  
Yes—Figma file, vectors (SVG), and exports (PNG) are yours.

**Are font licenses included?**  
We default to free/system options; paid licenses, if desired, are purchased separately by you.

**Can you animate the logo?**  
Absolutely—see the **Logo Animation Sting** add-on.

**What if we need a larger guide?**  
Upgrade to **Brand Guidelines Pro** for a 12–20 page manual with examples and do/don'ts.

## Notes

Two-week delivery assumes timely feedback and consolidated review notes. Additional rounds or complex illustration/mascot work can be scoped as add-ons.
