# ICP & PURPOSE (Phase 2)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
icp: "Marketing teams and founders who want consistent, on-brand social without a full-time designer."

painPoints:
  - "Publishing is slow and inconsistent across channels"

  - "Accessibility (alt text, contrast) is an afterthought"

outcomes:
  - "↑ Faster weekly content production"
  - "↑ Consistent, on-brand social presence"
  - "↑ Channel-optimized assets that look sharp everywhere"
  - "↓ Friction with reusable, editable templates"
  - "↑ Cohesive campaign visuals across posts and stories"

purpose: >
  Give your team an easy-to-edit system of branded templates and ready-to-post files that stay sharp across platforms.
