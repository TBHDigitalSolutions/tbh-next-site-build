## Purpose & Fit

Use this when you need a **repeatable narrative**—for launch, onboarding, fundraising,
or a new category page. The format explains the *why* and *how* quickly while creating
a consistent story your team can share.

---

## FAQs

**How long does the process take?**  
Typical turnaround is **2–3 weeks** from kickoff, assuming timely feedback.

**Can we include product UI?**  
Yes—provide clean captures or we can create motion composites. A dedicated UI capture
add-on is available if you need hands-on help.

**Do you support localization?**  
We can add subtitle tracks and re-record VO for target languages as an add-on.

**What about licensing?**  
We use properly licensed music/VO. Premium selections are passed through at cost with approval.

## Notes

Two consolidated revision rounds are included. Premium VO casting, custom music, live-action
filming, and complex 3D are available as add-ons. If you anticipate heavy narrative changes,
we recommend locking the script at the end of Week 1 to preserve timeline and budget.
