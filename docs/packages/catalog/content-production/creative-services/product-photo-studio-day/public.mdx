faqs:
  - id: throughput
    question: "How many SKUs can we shoot in a day?"
    answer: >
      Throughput depends on complexity and angles per SKU. Typical: 12–20 SKUs/day for standard pack-shots
      (3–5 angles each). Complex, reflective, or assembly-required products reduce throughput.
  - id: backgrounds
    question: "Which backgrounds are included?"
    answer: >
      White or light gray seamless is included. A brand-color seamless can be added (most common Pantones stocked).
      Specialty surfaces (wood, stone, acrylic) are pass-through rentals.
  - id: retouching
    question: "What does 'retouched select' include?"
    answer: >
      Dust/spot cleanup, edge refinement, exposure/color polish, and minor perspective tweaks. Complex
      compositing, object replacement, ghost-mannequin, and heavy reflection control are add-ons.
  - id: raw
    question: "Can we get RAW files?"
    answer: >
      Yes, via the RAW delivery add-on with usage agreement. Most teams prefer curated, color-managed exports.
  - id: rush
    question: "Do you offer rush turnaround?"
    answer: >
      Yes. 48-hour rush after selects is available as an add-on (subject to calendar and SKU complexity).
