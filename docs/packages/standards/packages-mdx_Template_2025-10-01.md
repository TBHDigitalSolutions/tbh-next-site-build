Got it‚Äîhere‚Äôs the **production-ready, hybrid MDX template** for external packages, updated to match the current architecture:

* **Hybrid model**: authors write **narrative only** in `public.mdx`.
* All **structured data** (outcomes, includes, price band copy, rails, extras, etc.) lives in **`external.json`**.
* **No pricing** (numbers, currency symbols, ‚Äústarting at‚Ä¶‚Äù) may appear in MDX.
* The build compiles MDX ‚Üí `narrative.*Html` and **attaches** it into the generated per-slug external JSON your app reads via the usual typed `base`.

# Where this file lives

```

```

# What this MDX controls (and how it maps)

| MDX section   | Generated external JSON field |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `## Overview` | `narrative.overviewHtml`      |
| `## Purpose`  | `narrative.purposeHtml`       |
| `## Notes`    | `narrative.notesHtml`         |
| `## FAQ`      | `narrative.faqHtml`           |

Everything else (meta, outcomes, includes, features, price band copy, extras, cross-sell, add-ons, sticky summary, SEO title/desc, etc.) is authored in **`external.json`** and/or **`internal.json`**.

# Production MDX template (copy this)

```md

# REQUIRED ‚Äî keep light; structured fields live in external.json
slug: smartdaw-strategic-flow              # must match folder name
title: SmartDAW Strategic Flow             # visible H1/title on page
summary: Align demand gen with sales, fast. # short value prop shown in hero and rail
status: Approved                           # Draft | In Review | Approved
authors: ["@owner-handle"]                 # optional list of handles

# OPTIONAL ‚Äî only for page <head>; structured SEO stays in external.json if you prefer

<!--
üí° Authoring guardrails (do not delete):

1) NO PRICING in MDX ‚Äî never include currency symbols, dollar amounts, or ‚Äústarting at‚Äù text.
2) Keep paragraphs short (2‚Äì4 sentences). Use headings & lists for scannability.
3) Links are allowed, but avoid deep technical docs here; this page is customer-facing narrative.
4) Accessibility: prefer descriptive link text (avoid ‚Äúclick here‚Äù).
-->

## Overview

A few short paragraphs (2‚Äì6 sentences total) that set context and promise the outcome.
Explain *what* the package is and *why now*, in plain language. Avoid feature lists here;
that comes later in the includes and outcomes on the page.

## Purpose

One focused paragraph (~3‚Äì5 sentences) describing the business outcome and how success
will be measured at a high level. Speak to exec/decision-maker context. Avoid technical
implementation details.

## Notes

- Scope assumptions or caveats that matter to buyers (e.g., limited to one ICP segment).
- What the team needs from the customer (but save the ‚Äúhard‚Äù requirements list for `external.json > extras.requirements`).
- Ethical guardrails at a high level (detail lives in `extras.ethics` in `external.json`).

## FAQ

### What if our CRM is messy?
We include a hygiene checklist; if critical gaps exist, we‚Äôll scope a patch project.

### How fast can we go live?
Typical projects complete in two weeks after access is granted.

### Who needs to be involved on our side?
A sales lead and a marketing/ops contact for 2√ó 60-minute workshops.

## Acceptance checklist (editors)

* [ ] **No pricing** or currency symbols appear anywhere in MDX.
* [ ] `slug` matches the folder name exactly.
* [ ] `title` and `summary` are present and written for customers.
* [ ] Overview ‚â§ ~150‚Äì200 words; Purpose is a single, clear paragraph.
* [ ] Notes are concise; detailed requirements/ethics go in **`external.json`**.
* [ ] FAQ entries (if present) use `###` headings and short answers.

## Quick reminder: where to put everything else

* **`external.json`** (public, structured): outcomes, features, includesGroups / includesTable, price **band copy** (tagline/note/finePrint/CTAs ‚Äî *no numbers*), extras (timelineBlocks, requirements, ethics), sticky summary, SEO, crossSell/addOns, tags/category/badges.
* **`internal.json`** (private): tiers, canonical **price** (numbers), margins, ops. Build may copy the canonical tier **price** into `priceBand.price` during synthesis.

This keeps your **hybrid** workflow clean, scalable, and compliant‚Äîand fixes the ‚Äúone big JSON‚Äù problem by letting the build emit **one generated external JSON per slug** with these MDX narratives attached.
