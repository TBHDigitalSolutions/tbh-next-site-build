Looking at the scripts in document 21-22 against the master templates and schema I created, there are some **alignment issues and gaps** that need addressing:

## Key Misalignments

### 1. **Field Name Inconsistencies**

The scripts use different field naming than the master schema:

**Scripts use:**
- `cross_sell.related[]` and `cross_sell.add_ons[]`
- `why_you_need_this`, `what_you_get`, `details_and_trust`, `next_step`

**Master schema uses:**
- Direct fields: `crossSell[]`, `addOns[]` (or `relatedSlugs[]`, `addOnRecommendations[]`)
- Flatter structure with these as top-level arrays

**Resolution needed:** The scripts should normalize to the master schema's field names during the transformation.

### 2. **Missing Schema Imports**

The scripts reference:
```typescript
import { PackageMarkdownSchema } from "@/packages/lib/mdx-frontmatter-schema";
import { PackageSchema } from "@/packages/lib/package-schema";
```

But I haven't seen these schema files. The master JSON schema I created should be the source of truth for `PackageSchema`. You'll need to:

1. Convert the JSON schema to Zod/TypeScript
2. Ensure `PackageMarkdownSchema` (author-facing) can have looser rules than `PackageSchema` (runtime)

### 3. **includesGroups vs includes Naming**

**Scripts expect:** `includesGroups` in frontmatter
**Master template uses:** `includes` as the field name (which contains groups)

This creates confusion. Recommendation:
- Standardize on `includes` in frontmatter (it's an array of groups)
- Scripts should not look for `includesGroups` as a separate field

### 4. **Service Code Mapping**

The `serviceDirFromCode()` function maps:
```typescript
"webdev" → "web-development"
"leadgen" → "lead-generation"
```

But the master schema just uses the service codes directly. You need to decide:
- Do registry folders use full names like `lead-generation-packages`?
- Or short codes like `leadgen-packages`?

### 5. **extras Field Handling**

The scripts look for `front.extras?.requirements` but the master template puts `requirements` at the top level of frontmatter, not nested under `extras`.

## What Needs to Happen

### Update the mirror script to match master schema:

```typescript
// Instead of nested structure:
const runtimeCandidate = {
  // ... nested why_you_need_this, what_you_get, etc.
}

// Use flat structure matching master:
const runtimeCandidate = {
  id: front.id,
  slug: front.slug,
  service: front.service,
  // ... other meta
  
  // Phase 2 fields (flat)
  painPoints: front.painPoints,
  icp: front.icp,
  outcomes: front.outcomes,
  purposeHtml: purposeHtml,
  
  // Phase 3 fields (flat)
  features: front.features,
  includes: front.includes, // NOT includesGroups
  includesTable: front.includesTable,
  deliverables: front.deliverables,
  
  // Phase 4 fields (flat)
  price: front.price,
  priceBand: front.priceBand,
  requirements: front.requirements, // NOT front.extras.requirements
  timeline: front.timeline,
  ethics: front.ethics,
  limits: front.limits,
  notes: front.notes,
  
  // Phase 5 fields (flat)
  faqs: front.faqs,
  crossSell: front.crossSell, // or relatedSlugs
  addOns: front.addOns, // or addOnRecommendations
  
  seo: front.seo,
  copy: front.copy,
}
```

### Create Proper Schema Files

You need these two files that the scripts reference:

1. **`src/packages/lib/package-schema.ts`** - Runtime schema (strict)
2. **`src/packages/lib/mdx-frontmatter-schema.ts`** - Author schema (more forgiving)

I can generate these from the master JSON schema if you need them.

### Standardize Field Access

Pick ONE naming convention:
- Either `includes` (simpler, matches most examples)
- Or `includesGroups` (more explicit)

Don't support both unless you normalize in the scripts.

## Bottom Line

The scripts are **structurally sound** but use a **nested/namespaced JSON structure** that doesn't match the **flat structure** in the master schema and templates. You need to either:

1. **Update the scripts** to output the flat structure (recommended)
2. **Update the master schema** to use the nested structure (more complex)

I'd recommend option 1 - keep the master schema's flat structure since it's simpler and matches most of your real MDX examples.

Would you like me to create the corrected versions of these scripts aligned with the master schema?
