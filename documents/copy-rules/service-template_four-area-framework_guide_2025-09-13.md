- Expands two-lens framework into four specific areas: Add-Ons, Capabilities, Services, and Pricing
- Provides universal template adaptable to any service (marketing, SEO, web dev, etc.)
- Cross-references building-service-info framework for consistent service documentation

Summary: The Service Template Four-Area Framework Guide builds upon the two-lens service framework to create a comprehensive four-part structure covering Add-On Deliverable Packages, Service Capabilities (process & value stack), Client-Facing Services (offerings menu), and Pricing transparency. This universal template ensures consistent documentation across all TBH Digital Solutions services, providing a standardized approach that covers what you offer, how you deliver, pricing structure, and available add-ons for any service category.

Perfect — I see exactly what you’re aiming for 👍. You want a **universal template/checklist** based on the four-part framing we built for video production, but adaptable to *any service* (marketing, SEO, web dev, etc.).

Here’s how you can use it as a **general service template**:

---

# 📝 General Service Template / Checklist

## 📦 Add-On Deliverable Packages

*(Optional upsells that extend the core service)*

* Defined a suite of **optional add-ons** (customize per service — e.g., Social Packs for video, Retargeting Ads for marketing, Maintenance Packages for web dev).
* Created **tables or comparison matrices** to clearly show inclusions.
* Designed client-facing **assets** (sales sheets, website sections, proposal PDFs).

👉 **Ask yourself:** Does this service have add-ons clients can buy to extend value?

---

## ⚙️ \[Service Name] Capabilities (Process & Value Stack)

*(The “engine” — how you deliver consistent quality)*

* Mapped out the **core pillars/steps** (e.g., for SEO: Audit, Keyword Research, On-Page, Link Building, Reporting).
* Built a **capabilities matrix** linking deliverables to each stage.
* Positioned as your **value stack** — what’s included every time.

👉 **Ask yourself:** Have I shown the “how & why” behind the service, not just the deliverables?

---

## 📋 \[Service Name] Services (Offerings / Menu)

*(The “menu” — what clients see and choose from)*

* Expanded the **service list** beyond one-liners into client-facing categories.
* Built a **Services Matrix** (industries × service types × use cases).
* Integrated the relevant **service directory** (your actual packages, campaign types, etc.).

👉 **Ask yourself:** Have I clearly laid out the different service options and who they’re for?

---

## 💲 \[Service Name] — Pricing

*(Front-of-house, client-facing transparency)*

* Structured **tiers/packages** (e.g., Starter / Pro / Enterprise).
* Built both a **pricing matrix** (summary view) and a **detailed comparison table** (feature-by-feature breakdown).
* Added **add-on pricing options** and disclaimers.
* Designed outputs for **PDF proposals, website tables, and responsive components**.

👉 **Ask yourself:** Is the pricing presented in a clear, client-facing way (with tiers, inclusions, transparency)?

# ✅ The Four-Part Framework Covers

1. **What you offer (Services)**
2. **How you deliver (Capabilities)**
3. **How it’s priced (Pricing)**
4. **What can be added on (Add-Ons)**

---

✨ By plugging any of your 6 services (content production, lead gen, marketing, SEO, video production, web development) into this structure, you’ll have a **consistent playbook**. Clients will instantly see: *the menu, the engine, the value, the price.*

---

Would you like me to also make a **fill-in-the-blank version** of this template (like a skeleton with placeholders) so you can literally copy/paste it and build out each of your six services in the same format?
