- Introduces framework separating "Production Process & Value Stack" from "Client-Facing Offerings"
- Provides checklist for building service info covering both behind-the-scenes and front-facing content
- Includes copywriting flow for effective service page structure

Summary: The Service Content Two-Lens Framework Guide establishes a strategic approach to developing service content by separating internal capabilities (production process and value stack) from external offerings (client-facing packages and solutions). It provides comprehensive checklists for both perspectives, ensuring service pages effectively communicate both the quality and methodology behind services as well as clear, actionable offerings clients can purchase, with a proven copywriting flow that moves from problem identification through proof points to clear calls-to-action.

That’s a great observation 👍 —
You’ve basically landed on a **two-lens framework**:

* **Production process & value stack** = the *behind-the-scenes engine* (how you work, what’s always included, why clients can trust the quality).
* **Client-facing offerings** = the *front-of-house menu* (what you sell, how it’s packaged, where it applies, what it costs).

👉 This isn’t “official” industry terminology, but it’s **very effective**. Agencies often use less clear labels like “Our Capabilities” (value stack) and “Our Solutions” or “Packages” (offerings). By naming them clearly, you make it intuitive for clients and easier for your team to structure materials.

# 📝 Mini Checklist for Building Service Info & Copy

When you create content for **any service or capability page**, run through these 2 buckets:

---

## ✅ Production Process & Value Stack (the “How & Why”)

Make sure you answer: *“What do we always bring to the table, no matter the project?”*

* **Process Steps**: Break down your stages (planning, production, post, delivery).
* **Deliverables per Stage**: List what’s actually done at each stage.
* **Quality Signals**: Tools, expertise, standards (cinema-grade, broadcast-ready, revisions included).
* **Value Adds**: What clients *get without asking* (project management, multi-platform delivery, dedicated support).
* **Proof**: Tie it back to outcomes — efficiency, consistency, ROI.

---

## ✅ Client-Facing Offerings (the “What & For Whom”)

Make sure you answer: *“What can a client actually buy, and how do they use it?”*

* **Service Types**: Core menu (e.g., brand films, explainers, testimonials, ads, events).
* **Industries / Use Cases**: Where they apply (tech, e-comm, nonprofit, healthcare, etc.).
* **Packages & Pricing**: Clear tiers, “starting at…” numbers, and what’s included.
* **Add-Ons**: Optional extras (content packs, analytics, distribution, talent, etc.).
* **Positioning / Benefits**: Why this offering solves their problem or meets their goal.
* **CTAs**: Always end with a clear next step (Book a consult, Request a quote).

## 🎯 Pro-Tip Flow for Copywriting

When writing each service page or PDF:

1. **Hook**: State the client’s problem or opportunity.
2. **Solution (Offering)**: Show the package/service they can buy.
3. **Value Stack (Process)**: Reassure with your 6 pillars or equivalent process.
4. **Proof**: Testimonials, case studies, or stats.
5. **Action**: Strong CTA with a clear path forward.

---

This way, every asset you build (website page, PDF, proposal slide, service doc) covers **both the *engine* and the *menu*** — clients see what they’re buying and why it’ll succeed.

---

👉 Do you want me to create a **one-page printable version of this checklist** (like a branded PDF you can keep on your desk and reference when writing service pages)?
