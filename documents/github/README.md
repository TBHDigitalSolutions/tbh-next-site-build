# Git Docs Index

This index collects all Git & GitHub related documentation into one place. It is designed to help both new developers and experienced contributors navigate daily workflows, branching strategies, tools, and reference material.

---

## Workflows

* [**Git Daily Workflow Guide**](./git-workflow_Guide_2025-10-01.md)
  A full day-to-day reference for working with Git in VS Code. Covers checking repo status, running sanity checks, staging and committing, pushing, keeping `main` up to date, undoing changes, and stashing. Explains push variants (`git push` vs `git push origin main`), making it an essential how-to guide for new developers.

* [**Git Workflow Cheat Sheet**](./git-workflow_CheatSheet_2025-10-01.md)
  A compact quick-reference companion to the Guide. Provides copy-pasteable commands for the daily flow, explains origin vs upstream, and highlights common fixes. Ideal for quick lookups. Links back to the full Guide for deeper explanations.

* [**Branch Workflow**](./git-branch-workflow_Workflow_2025-10-01.md)
  A practical step-by-step branching workflow. Includes diagrams showing how local â†’ remote and feature â†’ main branches flow, and explains how to create, push, PR, and merge feature branches cleanly. Designed for developers who want a visual and structured process.

* [**Branch Best Practices**](./git-branch-workflow_BestPractices_2025-10-01.md)
  A conceptual companion to the Branch Workflow. Explains *why* `main` must stay stable, the role of PRs and squash merges, and when to use branches vs forks. Offers strategy and philosophy behind Git usage, not just commands.

---

## Tools

* [**Git Health Tool**](./git-health_Tool_2025-10-01.md)
  A ready-to-use shell script (`scripts/git-health.sh`) with a guide. Provides a fast snapshot of repo, branch, upstream, and sync state. Reports ahead/behind counts, cleanliness, remote connectivity, and last commit info. Recommended before pushing or after rebasing/merging to ensure your local branch is safe to push.

---

## Reference

* [**Git Glossary**](./git-glossary_Reference_2025-10-01.md)
  A plain-language glossary of Git & GitHub terms written for beginners. Explains repos, branches, commits, upstreams, remotes, push/pull, HTTPS vs SSH, tags, and more. Designed so a new developer (even age 15) can understand Git concepts clearly. Serves as a foundation for all the other docs.
