Got you. Here are the exact commands you’ll use from Terminal on macOS.

# Quick: commit & push to existing remote

```bash
# See what changed
git status

# Stage everything (adds, edits, deletes)
git add -A

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Your clear commit message"

# Push to the current branch’s upstream (or set it on first push)
git push
```

If your branch has no upstream yet:

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

# First-time setup (if this folder isn’t a repo yet)

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Replace with your repo URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/<repo>.git

# Make sure you’re on main (or keep whatever branch you use)
git branch -M main

# First push
git push -u origin main
```

# Create a new feature branch and push

```bash
git checkout -b feat/about-page-refactor
git add -A
git commit -m "Refactor About page to page-level data"
git push -u origin feat/about-page-refactor
```

# Keep secrets & junk out of Git

Make sure these are ignored (create/update `.gitignore` in your project root):

```bash
# Essentials
echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore
echo ".env*.local" >> .gitignore
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
echo ".next/" >> .gitignore
echo "coverage/" >> .gitignore
echo "dist/" >> .gitignore
```

# Common fixes

* **Auth prompts / 2FA**: If using HTTPS and you have 2FA on GitHub, use a **Personal Access Token** as the password.
* **Branch has diverged**:

  ```bash
  git pull --rebase origin $(git branch --show-current)
  # resolve conflicts if any, then:
  git push
  ```
* **Change remote URL (SSH instead of HTTPS)**:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<you>/<repo>.git
  ```

That’s it. Replace the repo URL/branch names as needed and you’re good to push.


---

Short version: your commit/push worked fine ✅. The only hiccup was the first command; it failed because Git couldn’t find that path from your current directory (and/or those files weren’t tracked).

## What happened

* `git rm -r --cached src/data/packages/__generated__`

  * Failed with: “did not match any files.”
  * Causes:

    * You were in `documents/` when you ran it, so the path Git looked for was `documents/src/.../__generated__`.
    * Also possible: the `__generated__` files were never tracked (already ignored), so there was nothing to untrack.

* `git add -A && git commit ... && git push`

  * All good. You converted `.md` → `.mdx`, added the scripts, and pushed to `main`.

## Make the “don’t commit generated files” change stick

If you truly want these artifacts to be generated in CI and not live in Git:

1. Add ignores (or confirm they exist) in `.gitignore`:

```
# generated at build
src/data/packages/__generated__/
src/data/packages/packages.json
```

> Only ignore `packages.json` if your app builds it in CI before use. If dev/runtime needs it present in the repo, don’t ignore it.

2. Untrack anything already committed (run from repo root or anchor with `:/`):

```bash
# list what’s tracked under __generated__
git ls-files src/data/packages/__generated__ -z | xargs -0 -n1 echo

# untrack only if any are listed
git ls-files -z src/data/packages/__generated__ | xargs -0 git rm --cached -r

# optionally untrack packages.json if you chose to ignore it
git rm --cached :/src/data/packages/packages.json

git commit -m "chore(generated): stop tracking build artifacts"
git push
```

(If you prefer to keep `packages.json` tracked, skip that line and the ignore entry for it.)

## Quality-of-life tips

* When operating on repo-root paths from any subfolder, anchor with `:/`:

  ```bash
  git rm -r --cached :/src/data/packages/__generated__
  ```
* Verify ignore behavior:

  ```bash
  git check-ignore -v src/data/packages/__generated__/bundles.enriched.json
  git ls-files src/data/packages/__generated__
  ```
* If moving fully to CI, add a build step that generates these before the app uses them:

  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/build.yml (snippet)
  - run: npm ci
  - run: npm run packages:compile-mdx
  - run: npm run packages:attach-content
  - run: npm run packages:build-search
  - run: npm run packages:export-packages
  ```

If you want, I can produce a one-shot command block that safely untracks only what’s currently committed and leaves the rest alone.
