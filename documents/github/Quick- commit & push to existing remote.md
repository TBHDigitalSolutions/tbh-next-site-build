Got you. Here are the exact commands you’ll use from Terminal on macOS.
Great—one tidy commit coming up. Here’s a safe, minimal sequence and a solid conventional commit message you can paste.

## 1) (Optional but recommended) sanity checks

```bash
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build
```

## 2) Stage everything and commit as one

```bash
git add -A

git commit -m "feat(packages): polish PackageDetailOverview + UI molecules and theme"
git commit --amend -m "feat(packages): polish PackageDetailOverview + UI molecules and theme" \
  -m "• Centered TitleBlock; improved typography hierarchy
• Grid-based highlights via FeatureList (desktop 2-col; mobile stack)
• Tightened Outcomes/Includes/Notes blocks and CTA/Price presentation
• Tweaks to OutcomeList/PriceLabel styles for consistency
• Updated PackagesDetailTemplate glue + unified-theme tokens
• No breaking API changes; visual and layout refinements only"
```

> The second command adds a detailed body (kept as one commit). If you prefer a single-line message, skip the `--amend` block.

## 3) Push to `main`

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Notes

* You’re on `main` and in sync with `origin/main`, so this will fast-forward without conflicts.
* If your repo uses commit linting (Conventional Commits), the `feat(packages): …` scope should pass.
* Want a signed commit? Replace `git commit` with `git commit -S` (if GPG/S/MIME is set up).

---

Your commands will work, but I’d tighten the process and make the commit message clearer (subject ≤72 chars; details in body). Here are two good options you can paste.

# Option A — single squashed commit (multi-line, conventional)

```bash
git add -A
git status

git commit -m "feat(pricing+price-components+card): unify types and integrate PriceActionsBand" -m "
- Add shared Money type and formatMoney helpers in src/packages/lib/pricing.ts
  • normalizeMoney, srPriceSentence, isHybrid/only predicates
- Refactor PriceLabel: inline/block, chip appearance for hybrids, ARIA sentence,
  index exports, token-only CSS
- Refactor PriceTeaser: band vs inline modes, chip support, SR-only phrasing,
  no tagline/fine-print leakage, shared Money import
- PriceActionsBand: PRESET map (badge placement, teaser mode, base/fine visibility,
  divider), monthly-only default baseNote=proposal, remove double-divider,
  consistent CTARow props
- PackageCard (default/rail/pinned): use card-hybrid/oneTime band, chips on hybrids,
  no base note/fine print on cards, fix footnote [object Object], analytics attrs
- CSS: container queries + tokenized colors (PackageCard/PriceActionsBand/PriceTeaser)
- Docs: README for PriceActionsBand
"

git push origin main
```

# Option B — best practice (branch + PR)

If you can, do this on a feature branch and open a PR (easier to review/revert):

```bash
git checkout -b feat/price-actions-band
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(pricing+price-components+card): unify types and integrate PriceActionsBand" -m "
(see body above)
"
git push -u origin feat/price-actions-band
# open PR on GitHub
```

# Quick tips

* Run checks before pushing:

  ```bash
  pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
  ```

* If you already pushed and need to tweak the message:

  ```bash
  git commit --amend
  git push --force-with-lease
  ```

* If your repo prefers Conventional Commits, the subject I used fits that style. If not, you can replace the subject with your original phrasing and keep the detailed body bullets.

This keeps the history readable and makes the changes (pricing lib + components + cards + CSS + docs) crystal clear.

# Quick: commit & push to existing remote

```bash
# See what changed
git status

# Stage everything (adds, edits, deletes)
git add -A

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Your clear commit message"

# Push to the current branch’s upstream (or set it on first push)
git push
```

If your branch has no upstream yet:

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

# First-time setup (if this folder isn’t a repo yet)

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Replace with your repo URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/<repo>.git

# Make sure you’re on main (or keep whatever branch you use)
git branch -M main

# First push
git push -u origin main
```

# Create a new feature branch and push

```bash
git checkout -b feat/about-page-refactor
git add -A
git commit -m "Refactor About page to page-level data"
git push -u origin feat/about-page-refactor
```

# Keep secrets & junk out of Git

Make sure these are ignored (create/update `.gitignore` in your project root):

```bash
# Essentials
echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore
echo ".env*.local" >> .gitignore
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
echo ".next/" >> .gitignore
echo "coverage/" >> .gitignore
echo "dist/" >> .gitignore
```

# Common fixes

* **Auth prompts / 2FA**: If using HTTPS and you have 2FA on GitHub, use a **Personal Access Token** as the password.
* **Branch has diverged**:

  ```bash
  git pull --rebase origin $(git branch --show-current)
  # resolve conflicts if any, then:
  git push
  ```
* **Change remote URL (SSH instead of HTTPS)**:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<you>/<repo>.git
  ```

That’s it. Replace the repo URL/branch names as needed and you’re good to push.


---

Short version: your commit/push worked fine ✅. The only hiccup was the first command; it failed because Git couldn’t find that path from your current directory (and/or those files weren’t tracked).

## What happened

* `git rm -r --cached src/data/packages/__generated__`

  * Failed with: “did not match any files.”
  * Causes:

    * You were in `documents/` when you ran it, so the path Git looked for was `documents/src/.../__generated__`.
    * Also possible: the `__generated__` files were never tracked (already ignored), so there was nothing to untrack.

* `git add -A && git commit ... && git push`

  * All good. You converted `.md` → `.mdx`, added the scripts, and pushed to `main`.

## Make the “don’t commit generated files” change stick

If you truly want these artifacts to be generated in CI and not live in Git:

1. Add ignores (or confirm they exist) in `.gitignore`:

```
# generated at build
src/data/packages/__generated__/
src/data/packages/packages.json
```

> Only ignore `packages.json` if your app builds it in CI before use. If dev/runtime needs it present in the repo, don’t ignore it.

2. Untrack anything already committed (run from repo root or anchor with `:/`):

```bash
# list what’s tracked under __generated__
git ls-files src/data/packages/__generated__ -z | xargs -0 -n1 echo

# untrack only if any are listed
git ls-files -z src/data/packages/__generated__ | xargs -0 git rm --cached -r

# optionally untrack packages.json if you chose to ignore it
git rm --cached :/src/data/packages/packages.json

git commit -m "chore(generated): stop tracking build artifacts"
git push
```

(If you prefer to keep `packages.json` tracked, skip that line and the ignore entry for it.)

## Quality-of-life tips

* When operating on repo-root paths from any subfolder, anchor with `:/`:

  ```bash
  git rm -r --cached :/src/data/packages/__generated__
  ```
* Verify ignore behavior:

  ```bash
  git check-ignore -v src/data/packages/__generated__/bundles.enriched.json
  git ls-files src/data/packages/__generated__
  ```
* If moving fully to CI, add a build step that generates these before the app uses them:

  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/build.yml (snippet)
  - run: npm ci
  - run: npm run packages:compile-mdx
  - run: npm run packages:attach-content
  - run: npm run packages:build-search
  - run: npm run packages:export-packages
  ```

If you want, I can produce a one-shot command block that safely untracks only what’s currently committed and leaves the rest alone.
Nice push! That last error came from pasting a multi-line commit message directly into the shell: the leading `>` started a redirection, and zsh then choked (“illegal modifier”). Two safe ways to fix the message you already pushed:

---

## Option A — amend with two `-m` flags (quick & copy-paste safe)

```bash
git commit --amend \
  -m "feat!: centralize registry mappers, unify pricing utils, add band helper" \
  -m "Highlights
- Add /packages/lib/registry with mappers.ts and types.ts (CTA policy, card/detail props, includes table, safe footnotes).
- Unify pricing in src/packages/lib/pricing.ts (named + default export).
- Add band helpers in src/packages/lib/band.ts including bandPropsFor().
- Centralize copy in src/packages/lib/copy.ts (CTA, BASE_NOTE, BADGE).
- Remove legacy price.ts and cta.ts (superseded by pricing.ts + mappers + copy.ts).
- Align PriceActionsBand / PriceTeaser / PriceLabel / PackageCard / PackageDetailOverview to shared Money type and helpers.

Details
- pricing.ts: normalizeMoney, formatMoney, srPriceSentence, startingAtLabel, isHybrid/isMonthlyOnly/isOneTimeOnly.
- band.ts: resolveBandVariant, defaultBaseNote, resolveBaseNoteText, bandPropsFor(ctx, price, copy).
- mappers.ts: normalizeFootnote; buildIncludesTable; cardCtas/sectionCtas; buildPackageCardProps; buildPackageDetailOverviewProps; pinned card builder.

UX/Policy
- Cards: badge-left + inline or chips; no base note or fine print.
- Detail: badge-above + stacked figure + base note + fine print + divider.
- No tagline fallback from summary; only priceBand.tagline when provided.

BREAKING CHANGE
- Remove src/packages/lib/price.ts and src/packages/lib/cta.ts.

Migration
- Replace imports from lib/price -> lib/pricing; lib/cta -> lib/copy and mappers.ts CTA builders.
- Use buildPackageCardProps(base, { variant }) and buildPackageDetailOverviewProps(base) in registry folders."
```

Because it’s two separate `-m` arguments, the shell won’t interpret the internal quotes or newlines.

Then update the remote (since you already pushed):

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

---

## Option B — open the editor (safest for longer bodies)

```bash
git commit --amend
# paste the message template, save, exit
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

---

### Pro tips to avoid this again

* Don’t paste raw multi-line text starting with `>` in your terminal—that’s a redirect.
* Prefer `-m "subject" -m "body"` or `git commit --amend` to open your editor.
* If you need full control, use a here-doc:

```bash
git commit --amend -F - <<'MSG'
feat!: centralize registry mappers, unify pricing utils, add band helper

Highlights
- …
MSG
```

You’re all set—run Option A or B and your history will be clean and documented.
Great timing—your draft is solid, but a couple tweaks will make it crystal-clear and also keep your history clean (you currently have staged **and** unstaged edits to the same files).

Below is a polished Conventional Commit message that matches what’s **already staged**, plus a quick plan/commands to (a) include the additional unstaged changes or (b) split them into a follow-up commit.

## ✅ Recommended commit message (matches your staged files)

> Use this exact text for the commit you’re making right now.

```
feat(pricing,band,price-components): unify Money + helpers; integrate PriceActionsBand

- pricing.ts: add normalizeMoney, formatMoney, srPriceSentence, startingAtLabel,
  and predicates (isHybrid/isMonthlyOnly/isOneTimeOnly). Provide both named and
  default exports to avoid import drift.
- band.ts: add resolveBandVariant, defaultBaseNote, resolveBaseNoteText.
- copy.ts: centralize CTA/BADGE/BASE_NOTE labels.
- PriceTeaser: support band vs inline modes, chip appearance for hybrids,
  shared Money import, SR-only phrasing, no tagline/fine-print leakage.
- PriceTeaser.module.css: tokenized colors, container-aware alignment.
- PriceLabel: inline/block modes, chip appearance for hybrids, SR sentence,
  index export hygiene, token-only CSS.

Policy:
- Cards use badge-left + inline (chips for hybrid); no base note or fine print.
- Detail page uses badge-above + stacked figure + base note + fine print.

Refs: README for PriceActionsBand.
```

## 🧭 You also have unstaged changes (decide now)

Your status shows **unstaged** edits to files you already staged (`band.ts`, `pricing.ts`, `copy.ts`) plus registry and deletion of `cta.ts`. If you commit right now, those extra edits won’t be included.

You have two good options:

### Option A — include everything in this commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit --amend -F - <<'MSG'
feat(pricing,band,price-components): unify Money + helpers; integrate PriceActionsBand

- pricing.ts: add normalizeMoney, formatMoney, srPriceSentence, startingAtLabel,
  and predicates (isHybrid/isMonthlyOnly/isOneTimeOnly). Provide both named and
  default exports to avoid import drift.
- band.ts: add resolveBandVariant, defaultBaseNote, resolveBaseNoteText, bandPropsFor().
- copy.ts: centralize CTA/BADGE/BASE_NOTE labels + ARIA helpers.
- PriceTeaser: support band vs inline modes, chip appearance for hybrids,
  shared Money import, SR-only phrasing, no tagline/fine-print leakage.
- PriceTeaser.module.css: tokenized colors, container-aware alignment.
- PriceLabel: inline/block modes, chip appearance for hybrids, SR sentence,
  index export hygiene, token-only CSS.

Policy:
- Cards use badge-left + inline (chips for hybrid); no base note or fine print.
- Detail page uses badge-above + stacked figure + base note + fine print.

BREAKING CHANGE: remove src/packages/lib/cta.ts (use copy.ts + mappers in registry)

Refs: README for PriceActionsBand.
MSG

# If you had already pushed this commit before amending:
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Option B — keep this commit small; follow with a focused registry commit

1. Finish the current commit with the “Recommended commit message” above.
2. Then stage & commit the registry and deletions:

```bash
# Stage the rest (registry + deleted cta.ts + any lingering lib edits)
git add -A

git commit -m "feat(registry): add mappers/types and migrate CTA policy
- Add /packages/lib/registry with mappers.ts and types.ts
- Centralize CTA builders (cardCtas/sectionCtas) and includes-table mapper
- Map priceBand copy (no tagline fallback from summary)
- Normalize footnotes to avoid [object Object]
- Update registry card/details to call builders
BREAKING CHANGE: remove src/packages/lib/cta.ts; import CTA labels from copy.ts and CTA builders from mappers.ts
"

git push origin main
```

---

## 🧹 Quick sanity checklist

* **Imports**

  * No references to `src/packages/lib/price.ts` (it’s deleted).
  * Use `import { formatMoney, isHybrid, ... } from "@/packages/lib/pricing"` or
    `import pricing from "@/packages/lib/pricing"` (default object) if legacy paths remain.
  * No imports from `lib/cta.ts`; use `copy.ts` for labels and `mappers.ts` CTA builders.

* **Band rules**

  * Monthly-only default `baseNote = "proposal"` (hybrid also “proposal”, one-time “final”).
  * Only **detail** surfaces pass `tagline`/`finePrint`.
  * No duplicate divider lines (band uses `<Divider/>` only).

* **Registry**

  * `priceBand.tagline` never falls back to `summary`.
  * `normalizeFootnote()` applied anywhere footnotes are shown.
  * `buildPackageCardProps(base, { variant })` and
    `buildPackageDetailOverviewProps(base)` used in per-package folders (or
    reduce local `card.ts`/`details.ts` to thin wrappers that call these).

---

If you want a single command to drop in your final message without fighting the editor, use the here-doc pattern:

```bash
git commit -F - <<'MSG'
<paste the Recommended commit message here>
MSG
```

You’re good to go.
You’re seeing a classic **non-fast-forward** because you amended local history (`--amend`) while `origin/main` has new commits you don’t have yet. Here’s the safest way to reconcile and push your work.

# Option A (recommended): Rebase onto the latest `origin/main`

```bash
# 1) Make sure you’re on main and your worktree is clean
git switch main
git status

# 2) Fetch the latest remote refs
git fetch origin

# (optional) See what you’re missing / what you’ve added
git log --oneline main..origin/main      # commits you need to pull
git log --oneline origin/main..main      # commits you have locally

# 3) Rebase your amended commit(s) on top of the remote main
git rebase origin/main
# If conflicts appear:
#   - fix files
#   - git add -A
#   - git rebase --continue
#   - repeat until rebase completes

# 4) Sanity check the history
git log --oneline --graph --decorate -n 15

# 5) Push normally (no force needed after a clean rebase)
git push origin main
```

This keeps the remote history intact, puts your amended commit on top, and avoids rewriting anyone else’s work.

---

# Option B (only if you truly intend to rewrite remote history): force-with-lease

Use this **only** if you’re certain no one else’s new commits on `origin/main` should be kept (or you’ve coordinated and branch protection allows it).

```bash
# Double-check divergence first:
git fetch origin
git log --oneline origin/main..main      # your local-only commits
git log --oneline main..origin/main      # their remote-only commits

# If you still intend to overwrite remote history:
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

`--force-with-lease` is safer than `--force`: it refuses to push if `origin/main` moved in a way you haven’t fetched.

---

## If you prefer a merge (not rebase)

This creates a merge commit instead of replaying your changes:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
# resolve conflicts → git add -A → git commit
git push origin main
```

---

## Tips to avoid this next time

* Avoid `--amend` on `main` in shared repos. Use a feature branch/PR:

  ```bash
  git switch -c feat/content-updates
  # commits …
  git push -u origin feat/content-updates
  ```

* If you must amend locally, **rebase** before pushing:

  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  git push origin main
  ```

If you run Option A as-is, your `git push` should succeed.
