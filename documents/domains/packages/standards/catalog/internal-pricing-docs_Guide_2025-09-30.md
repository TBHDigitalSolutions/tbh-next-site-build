## **Internal Pricing Documentation Guide**

This document outlines the three essential versions of your service package pricing and explains their distinct purposes. Every service package must have all three versions to ensure a consistent, scalable, and effective sales process.

---

### **1. The Overview**

The **InternalPricingDAW (Data/Analytics Workbench) Template** is a specialized tool for managing your service pricing and sales strategy. It standardizes how your team quotes and sells, providing a clear, structured framework for each service tier. The template captures essential internal details, including upsell triggers and pricing notes, ensuring your sales process is consistent, scalable, and focused on moving clients toward higher-value packages.

---

### **2. The Template (For Developers)**

This is the master **JSON template**. It's the blueprint for your documentation system and is intended for developers and automated tools. The document uses `{{ double brackets }}` as placeholders for dynamic data. It should **never be manually edited**.

**Why it's needed:** This standardized JSON format provides a clean data structure that enables your systemsâ€”like CRMs or pricing enginesâ€”to automatically generate documents. This ensures data integrity and consistency while making your process scalable.
