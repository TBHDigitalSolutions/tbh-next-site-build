### **External-Facing Package Documentation: A Data Field Guide**

This guide explains each data field within your marketing template, detailing its function, audience, and public-facing value. The goal is to ensure a single, consistent message across all of your public-facing materials.

---

### **1. The Core Identifiers (Internal Use Only)**

These fields provide a unique identity for each package, ensuring your internal systems can track and manage it. They are not visible to the public.

* **`ID`:** A unique identifier for the package, combining the service and slug (e.g., `seo-llm-answers`). This is for database and internal linking purposes.
* **`Slug`:** A clean, URL-friendly name for the package (e.g., `llm-answer-seo`).
* **`Service` & `Category`:** These tags help categorize packages for internal sorting and filtering (e.g., `seo`, `LLM SEO`).

---

### **2. The Public-Facing Value Proposition**

These fields are your primary marketing assets, directly communicating the service's value to the customer. They appear prominently on the website and in sales materials.

* **`SEO title`:** This is the meta title for the web page, designed to be compelling for both search engines and human readers. It's the first thing a user sees in search results.
* **`SEO description`:** A brief summary of the page's content for search results. It works alongside the title to attract clicks.
* **`Summary`:** A concise, 1-2 sentence value proposition. This is your "elevator pitch" and is used in places where space is limited, such as on a package card or as a headline.
* **`Description`:** The main marketing copy for the package. This section expands on the `Summary` with 1-3 short paragraphs, providing more context on the benefits and why the service is needed.
* **`Tags` & `Badges`:** These are public-facing labels that help customers quickly understand a package's key features or status (e.g., `popular`, `new`).

---

### **3. The Persuasive Elements**

These sections are strategically placed to build a case for your service, guiding the potential client from problem awareness to a confident decision.

* **`Pain Points`:** This field directly addresses the frustrations and problems your ideal customer is facing. It's designed to build empathy and show that you understand their needs.
* **`Purpose`:** Explains the positive business outcome or the "what good looks like" that the customer can expect from the service.
* **`ICP`:** (Ideal Customer Profile) A one-sentence description of the target audience. This helps customers self-identify if the service is a good fit for them.
* **`Outcomes`:** A list of key performance indicators (KPIs) and tangible results. This section makes your value proposition concrete and measurable, building trust and credibility.
* **`Highlights`:** A scannable list of the top 5 key features or benefits. This is perfect for at-a-glance comparisons and is often used on product cards or comparison pages.

---

### **4. The Trust & Transparency Builders**

These fields provide critical details that remove friction from the sales process, answer common questions, and set clear expectations.

* **`Whatâ€™s Included`:** A detailed, comprehensive list of everything a customer gets. This section is distinct from `Highlights` because it provides a full scope of work, leaving no ambiguity.
* **`Deliverables`:** A list of the specific, tangible assets or items a customer will receive (e.g., "Monthly Report," "Content Strategy Document").
* **`Pricing` & `Price Band`:** Canonical fields for pricing information, including the price, currency, and any qualifying notes like a tagline or fine print.
* **`Timeline`:** Details on the setup, launch, and ongoing cadence of the service. It helps set clear expectations and builds trust by being transparent.
* **`Requirements` & `Caveats`:** These sections proactively address potential obstacles or limitations, which shows professionalism and helps prevent project failures.
* **`FAQs`:** This field is designed to answer common questions and objections, removing friction and helping customers move closer to a decision.
* **`Cross-sell`:** These fields provide links to related services or add-ons, helping to increase the average deal size and provide more value to the client.

---

### **5. The Internal Tiers & Notes (Private Use Only)**

These fields are for your team's use only. They should never be publicly visible.

* **`Internal Tiers`:** A private object containing information about different service tiers, their prices, and internal notes on who they are "best for" and the problem they solve.
* **`Notes`:** A catch-all for any private, internal-only information related to the package.

By using this structured approach, you ensure that every part of your documentation has a clear purpose. You've separated the **"what it does for us"** (the internal fields) from the **"what it does for the customer"** (the public-facing fields), which is a key principle of effective business-to-business (B2B) marketing.
