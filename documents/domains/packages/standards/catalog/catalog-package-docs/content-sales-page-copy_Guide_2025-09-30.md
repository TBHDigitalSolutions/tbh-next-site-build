Moving from a conceptual framework to a concrete, customer-facing hierarchy is essential for creating a professional and persuasive page.
Here are some official and widely used names for each section of a B2B service page, following the flow we've established. These names are effective because they are clear, benefit-oriented, and set a professional tone.

    * **"Transparent Pricing"**
