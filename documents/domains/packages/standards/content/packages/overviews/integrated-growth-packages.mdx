# Integrated Growth Packages

*Complete business solutions that combine multiple TBH Digital Solutions services into one coordinated, results-driven program.*

## Overview

- **Operational simplicity** — One team, one brief, one source of truth  
- **Faster time-to-value** — Parallel workstreams and clear milestones  
- **Built-in governance** — Consistent standards for quality, analytics, and handoffs

> **Note:** Exact pricing and SKUs live in the single source of truth (`src/data/**`) and are attached at build time. This page remains narrative-only to avoid drift.
