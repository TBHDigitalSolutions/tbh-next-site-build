Excellent ✅ — I’ll do two things for you here:

1. **Create a client-facing sales sheet** for the 5 cross-service bundles (formatted in a clean grid for website or PDF).
2. **Give you a naming convention** to distinguish these **multi-service bundles** from your normal single-service add-ons/packages.

# 🏷️ Naming Convention

You already have:

* **Service Packages** → tied to a single hub/service (e.g., “Video Production Essential Package”).
* **Add-On Packages** → optional upsells (e.g., “Social Media Content Pack”).

For these **cross-service solutions**, I recommend calling them:

👉 **“Business Solutions Packages”**
(or **“Integrated Growth Packages”** if you want a more premium/agency feel).

### Why?

* “Solutions” communicates that these aren’t just deliverables — they’re **answers to real business problems**.
* It clearly separates them from **individual service packages** (menu of services).
* It also scales well: you can later add “Enterprise Growth Solutions” or “Startup Solutions.”

---

✅ So now you have:

* **Service Packages** (single-service tiers like Video Production Essential/Pro/Premium).
* **Add-On Packages** (optional upsells like Social Media Pack).
* **Business Solutions Packages** (cross-service bundles solving big problems).

👉 Do you want me to also generate a **PDF brochure version** of this 5-package sales sheet (branded, client-facing), so you can attach it in proposals or send it as a one-pager?
