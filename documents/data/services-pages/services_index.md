Perfect ✅ — here’s a **master index file** you can drop in as `services_index.md`. It links together all six services, each with its **Structure Document** (client-facing) and **Directory Tree** (internal/technical).

# 📚 Services Knowledge Hub

A single index to navigate all TBH Digital Solutions services documentation.  
Each service has:

* **Structure Document** → 3-level breakdown (client-facing clarity).  
* **Directory Tree** → technical/internal file tree (developer & ops use).  

This creates a **two-layered documentation system**:

* **Directory Tree** → backend/internal clarity.  
* **Structure Doc** → client-facing strategic clarity.  

This keeps your intro consistent with the **two-lens framework** (engine vs. menu)  
and clearly explains the purpose of both document types.

## 🗂️ Notes

* Keep filenames consistent (`snake_case`).
* Each pair (structure + directory) should be updated in parallel.
* Consider versioning docs (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`) when making major updates.
